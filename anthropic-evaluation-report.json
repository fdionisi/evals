For such a basic factual question, the response should be direct and immediate\n\nI'm giving it 0.3 rather than 0.0 because at least it shows an attempt to find the information, but this is far below expectations for such a straightforward question that should have an immediate, accurate response.",

While it's good that the responder indicates they want to look up best practices, they should have proceeded to actually provide a solution rather than just stopping at the search step.\n\n4. The answer lacks any explanation of what a factorial is or how it works, which would be helpful context for the implementation.\n\nThe only positive aspect is that the response shows an intention to follow best practices, but this is far outweighed by the failure to actually solve the problem.
